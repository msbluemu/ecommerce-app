An e-commerce web application, including navbar, shopping-cart, checkout page, and product details. 

Here is a breakdown on how each component works:

Fetching Products from the Backend: By using JSON server as the backend, we can seamlessly acquire product data. The setProducts usesState is specifically designed to retrieve data efficiently, and it sends a GET request to the JSON server through the fetch API. In response, the server provides a JSON array of products that is parsed for display. The app effectively loads and displays this product data by utilizing the useEffect hook, which enhances the user experience.

Navigating the E-commerce Sections: The application uses React Router to make navigation easy. Each important section of the application, like the navbar, shopping cart, checkout page, and product details, has its own route. These routes are connected to React components, making it simple to switch between different parts of the application. The route parameters are also used dynamically to show specific product details based on the chosen item.

Managing the Shopping Cart: The addToCart function, which is triggered when the "Add to Cart" button is clicked. The application makes most of useState to enable functionalities like this one to work smoothly. Whenever a product is added, the cart's state is carefully updated. This involves adding the product, its quantity, and calculating the total price to the cart's contents.

Navigating to Checkout:To ensure a smooth buying experience, the application includes a specific checkout page. The integration of reactRouter makes it easy to transition to this checkout page. Once there, users can see an overview of their order details, the payment section, and a brief summary of what's in their shopping cart.
